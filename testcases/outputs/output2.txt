Enter the number of drones/waypoints: Enter the minimum distance (delta_min): Enter drone positions (x y z):
Enter waypoint positions (x y z):
Optimal assignment:
Drone 0: (10, 5, 1)  -> Waypoint 0: (1, 1, 1)
Drone 1: (9, 6, 1)  -> Waypoint 1: (2, 2, 1)
Drone 2: (8, 7, 1)  -> Waypoint 3: (4, 4, 1)
Drone 3: (7, 8, 1)  -> Waypoint 4: (5, 5, 1)
Drone 4: (6, 9, 1)  -> Waypoint 2: (3, 3, 1)

Total cost of optimal assignment: 33.2249
