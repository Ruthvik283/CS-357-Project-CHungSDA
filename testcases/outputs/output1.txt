Enter the number of drones/waypoints: Enter the minimum distance (delta_min): Enter drone positions (x y z):
Enter waypoint positions (x y z):
Optimal assignment:
Drone 0: (1, 2, 3)  -> Waypoint 0: (1, 1, 1)
Drone 1: (4, 5, 6)  -> Waypoint 1: (4, 4, 4)
Drone 2: (7, 8, 9)  -> Waypoint 2: (7, 7, 7)

Total cost of optimal assignment: 6.7082
