Enter waypoint positions (x y z):
Optimal assignment:
Drone 0: (5, 0, 20)  -> Waypoint 4: (0, 0, 18)
Drone 1: (10, 0, 20)  -> Waypoint 0: (10, 0, 25)
Drone 2: (15, 0, 20)  -> Waypoint 1: (20, 0, 18)
Drone 3: (10, 0, 15)  -> Waypoint 2: (16, 0, 5)
Drone 4: (10, 0, 10)  -> Waypoint 3: (4, 0, 5)

Total cost of optimal assignment: 35.2425
