# Running Tests
The `code.cpp` file consists of the main code. To run it, first clone the git repository locally using `git clone https://github.com/ruthvik283/CS-357-Project-CHungSDA.git` and then you may run the tests using `run.sh` file as follows:

On the command line (within the directory "CS-357-Project-CHungSDA"), run:

```
./run.sh 1    # give the test case number 
```

You may also run the code manually using (Linux):
```
g++ code.cpp -o code
./code
```

On Windows:
```
g++ code.cpp -o code.exe
./code.exe
